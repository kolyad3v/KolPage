			<h2>A Record Keeping App along the Path</h2>
			<p>
				Using MongoDB I made an online record keeper that allowed me to note where I
				spent my time.
				<br />
				<br />
				Allows users to log in and create their own "paths" permitting CRUD
				operations for a time/activity record of the user's choosing. Also comes
				with pre-built paths with custom entry fields relating to fitness and diet.
				<br />
				<br />
				Utilises ThreeJS for more immersive dashboard experience.

			<h2>
				3D Room Demo / Planned video storage <br />
				<br />
			</h2>
			<p>
				This was intended to be a blend of a ThreeJS room experience which would
				represent a user's dashboard area. Here they could upload JiuJitsu videos
				for sharing and review by other practitions. I had some troubles here trying
				to upload and store video files, however look forward to taking another look
				at this using what .NET has to offer. Though it seems that video storage
				seems to be quite a beast unto it self so I may see what the youtube api has
				to offer instead.

			<h2>A 3D Countdown Based Scoring Game</h2>
			<p>
				My mother is the keen mushroom picker. Having been out on a few gathering
				sessions with her I tried to build a game that captured the unbounded
				excitement of mushroom picking. Mushrooms are based off real mushrooms.
				<br />
				<br />
				Got the basic gameplay, character movement and item collection in place.
				Plan to offer multiplay experience with in game chat, and updated
				environment and character.
