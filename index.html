			<h1>A Record Keeping App along the Path</h1>
			<p>
				Once I learned how to store data using MongoDB I decided to make an online
				record keeper that allowed me to note where I spent my time.
				<br />
				<br />

				I decided to create "NoblePaths"; paths that were essential for every user
				and come pre-built with custom entry features for every user. These include
				a journal, gym, wake and food path. A real challenge was the gym path as
				this required data handling from 3 level nested arrays from the API which
				then needed to be put into state for rendering to the client.
				<br />
				<br />

				Really like the outlined style of 3D art. Would like to make more use of
				this.

				3D Room Demo / Planned video storage <br />
				<br />
			</h1>
			<p>
				I need to take another look at this. I was trying to upload videos to the
				noSql database MongoDB but it looks like it may just be easier to use
				youtube's api for now. Some point I'll take another dive into video storage
				and see what the .Net has to offer in this area.

			<h1>A 3D Countdown Based Scoring Game</h1>
			<p>
				My mother is the keen mushroom picker. Having been out on a few gathering
				sessions with her I tried to build a game that captured the unbounded
				excitement of mushroom picking. Mushrooms are based off real mushrooms.
				<br />
				<br />
				Great fun making this and the API to handle the mushroom collection. Would
				like to evenutally create this in Electron and upload to Steam.
				<br />
				<br />
				I'd like to eventually get some kind of map wide chat system between
				cooperative users playing the level.
